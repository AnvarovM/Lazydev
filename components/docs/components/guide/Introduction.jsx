            Lazydev is a framework of UI components created with Vuejs to make
            projects easily and with a unique and pleasant style, vuesax is
            created from scratch and designed for all types of developers from
            the frontend lover to the backend who wants to easily create their
            visual approach to the end-user
          </li>
          <li className="text-primary dark:text-white font-light text-sm">
            We are focused on streamlining the work of the programmer by giving
            components created in their entirety and with independent
            customization and very easy to implement, so creativity is in our
            hands but we do not neglect that each project is different both
            visually and in its ecosystem
          </li>
          <li className="text-primary dark:text-white font-light text-sm">
            Lazydev does not have a design line such as other component
            frameworks based on Material Design, we believe that there are
            already emaciated frameworks that look visually and in UI / UX and
            we don't want to be one more of the bunch, apart from that we love
            to create and design new experiences and surprise you with new
            elements or details that we can only do by being visually free. #

            Lazydev, unlike many frameworks, is designed from scratch and we are
            not anchored to any design line, this is something great since your
            project is going to be unique and very different from the others
          </li>
          <li className="text-primary dark:text-white font-light text-sm">
            We are focused on the quick and easy creation of projects giving a
            beautiful visual line but without forgetting the personalization and
            independence of the developer
          </li>
          <li className="text-primary dark:text-white font-light text-sm">
            Lazydev uses native css variables for better customization and
            production changes such as changing to dark theme or changing the
            main color of the entire application with few javascript lines
          </li>
          <li className="text-primary dark:text-white font-light text-sm">
            Lazydev is a frame designed to have a great visual impact and that
            is always in trend with respect to design.
